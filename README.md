# ScreenDraw
A tool designed to allow me to draw on my screen while presenting. This project is inspired by the VSDC Screen Recorder (http://www.videosoftdev.com/) that captured you screen, and allowed you to draw/notate on the screen.

Basic goal - At the click of a button, freeze the screen and allow drawing using a mouse or pen. 

Specific goals:
Be able to screenshot a specific screen in a multi-monitor configuration
Dockable toolbar for when only 1 monitor is available
Hot-Key functionality for creating screenshot, erasing pen marks, removing screenshot, and choosing pen types
Integrate with stylus buttons for creating and removing screenshots
Logging and saving of screenshots in case of errors
Be 100% seamless to the viewer.
