# ScreenDraw
A tool designed to allow me to draw on my screen while presenting. This project is inspired by the VSDC Screen Recorder (http://www.videosoftdev.com/) that captured you screen, and allowed you to draw/notate on the screen.

Basic goal - At the click of a button, freeze the screen and allow drawing using a mouse or pen. 

Specific goals:<ul>
<li>Be able to screenshot a specific screen in a multi-monitor configuration</li>
<li>Dockable toolbar for when only 1 monitor is available</li>
<li>Hot-Key functionality for creating screenshot, erasing pen marks, removing screenshot, and choosing pen types</li>
<li>Integrate with stylus buttons for creating and removing screenshots</li>
<li>Logging and saving of screenshots in case of errors</li>
<li>Be 100% seamless to the viewer.</li>
  </ul>
